This summer, Code4Hope made its mark with a reimagined hackathon, engaging workshops, and impactful community initiatives—all focused on using technology for real-world, human-centered change.
**C4H'25 Hackathon** was far from a traditional competition. Rather than working off preset problem statements, participating teams chose fictional companies—ranging from techstartups to non-tech organizations—and tackled genuine challenges those companies could face. These problems spanned product issues, customer gaps, or the development of enterprise tools, all anchored in the idea that technology should help social impact organizations amplify their mission. The process began virtually in Round 1, where teams collaborated to identify solutions of genuine value. The Top 15 teams earned a golden ticket to Microsoft’s Times Square office, where they showcased their ideas in-person for industry leaders at Round 2. The structure championed innovation with purpose—challenging participants to create tools and systems that could empower organizations and benefit communities in tangible ways.

Our summer workshops were designed to deepen this impact. Things kicked off at C4H'25 at Microsoft with the “Hack to Business” session, where students were pushed to think beyond code and approach their projects like true startups—validating users, building marketing strategies, and aiming to create solutions that are actually useful in the real world. To bring the lesson home, teams were asked to brainstorm a fix for the prompt, “Ice cream that melts too fast.” Teams scrambled to think of something "cool" (see what I did there) and had just a minute to pitch their idea. Physics enthusiast Charles Ming stood out, pitching a clever device to solve our “serious” ice cream crisis. The activity was a powerful reminder that a little creativity (and a touch of humor) can help teams tackle any challenge.

Angel Rodriguez then led an engaging round table on the inner workings of Github, DevOps, and full-stack development. Angel transformed complex technical topics into relatable, practical discussions, encouraging thoughtful questions and active participation. The session felt more like a collaborative problem-solving workshop than a conventional lecture, making advanced concepts accessible to everyone in the room.

We continued our summer programming with Limit Digital’s workshop on fostering healthy digital habits. Their team offered practical advice for balancing device usage with overall well-being—a message especially needed in our hyper-connected world. Project CARE closed out our workshops with a session centered on their health and wellness mission. After discussing C4H’s Health and Wellness track, participants took part in an interactive activity: creating cards for hospitalized children. This touching moment highlighted the human side of technical education, reminding everyone that behind every innovation is a chance to lift others up.

Code4Hope 2025 was a truly transformative experience for Code4Hope and our participants. We congratulate our winner, Ryder Hornbeck, our Top 15 Finalists, and all who participated. We can't wait to do it again next year.

Throughout the summer, Code4Hope stayed committed to its mission: creating a space where thoughtful problem-solving, innovation, and social good go hand-in-hand. From inventive hackathon projects to workshops that combined big ideas with small gestures of kindness, this season was proof that technology, when focused on people and purpose, can make a real difference.

Love,
The Code4Hope Team
