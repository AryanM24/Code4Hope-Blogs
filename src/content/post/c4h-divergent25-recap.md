Landing back in New York for Code4Hope and Divergent Teams 2025 felt like a homecoming for our team. The energy inside Microsoft’s Times Square office was unmistakable—nearly 60 students dove into a one-day sprint hackathon, building products and pitches at lightning speed before presenting to a panel of Microsoft judges. The format rewarded urgency and clarity; teams had just hours to form ideas, gather  feedback from mentors, and show how technology could turn community challenges into working impact.

Before the judging window opened, Code4Hope took the stage to set the tone for the day. Founder Aryan Mittal and the Code4Hope executive board got the crowd hype for a day full of fun and building with an electric speech.

Later in the day, our “Hack to Business” workshop returned for an encore after its debut at C4H’25, this time adapted for Divergent Teams. Participants, judges, and even volunteers pulled chairs into a tight circle while we explored how to validate users, prototype fast, and pitch like founders. The live prompt was familiar—take a playful problem and craft a market-ready fix in minutes—but the dialogue felt new. Students and volunteers worked together and rushed to find creative ideas before presenting in front of our board, who gave them feedback and advice on their product.

One of the day’s standout moments came from our conversation with Rashmi Gupta, a Principal Program Manager at Microsoft and a panelist for the hackathon. Rashmi’s journey spans continents—she spent her early years in Singapore, continued her education in Australia, and now drives transformative initiatives in New York City. She spoke candidly about shaping a career as a woman in STEM, sharing how multicultural experiences gave her a systems-minded perspective on technology and inclusion. Her advice to the finalists was deceptively simple: stay curious about the people you build for, and let that curiosity guide every iteration. The interview, which we’ll publish in full soon, left students buzzing with new questions about leadership, service, and impact at scale.

Throughout the sprint, Microsoft engineers and mentors floated between tables, offering rapid feedback on architecture, storytelling, and execution. Teams used those micro-mentorship windows to tighten their demos, tune slide decks, and ground their solutions in measurable outcomes. When judging began, the energy we’d helped ignite earlier in the day was palpable—presentations were crisp, prototypes were daring, and the Q&A sessions brimmed with conviction.

C4H x Divergent 2025 stood out not just for its pace, but for its heart. Students left with new collaborators, fresh frameworks, and a renewed sense of how quickly ideas can gain traction when surrounded by a community that believes in building for good. Code4Hope is grateful for the chance to amplify that spirit, and we’re already looking forward to the next time we get to call New York the home field once again.

Love,  
The Code4Hope Team
