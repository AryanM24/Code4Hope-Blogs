This fall season marked a milestone for Code4Hope: we officially welcomed **Hoops4Hope** as our first partner under fiscal sponsorship, expanding our mission beyond code into athletics and community development. Their energy set the tone for a season all about building programs that meet students where they are and give them new ways to make an impact.

On November 11, we brought the community back to Microsoft’s Times Square office for the **Divergent x C4H Hackathon 2025**. Founder **Aryan Mittal** opened the day with an energetic speech, setting the stage for teams to design solutions with real-world users in mind.

Midway through the event, we ran our signature **“Hack to Business”** workshop—pushing participants to validate users, define value props, and pitch like they were building a venture, not just a project.

Executive Marketing Director **Maira Batra** and Executive Event Director **Ranya Chaudhary** led a dynamic interview with **Rashmi Gupta**, Managing Director, Healthcare & Life Sciences at Microsoft. She shared candid insights on leading high-performance teams and navigating STEM as a woman at the top of her field, sparking thoughtful questions from students about career pathfinding and inclusive leadership.

We closed out programming with a workshop from fintech startup and nonprofit **KODA Finance**, giving participants a crash course on building products that balance technical rigor with financial responsibility. The session sharpened teams’ thinking on how to launch sustainable tools that serve real users.

Fall 2025 was proof that Code4Hope is growing into a platform where partnerships, hands-on learning, and purpose-driven tech all meet. With new collaborators and a community eager to build, we’re excited for what’s ahead.

Love,
The Code4Hope Team
