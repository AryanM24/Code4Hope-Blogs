Coming back to New York always feels like stepping into home turf, but Divergent Teams 2025 made the homecoming electric. The one-day sprint hackathon packed more than 60 students into Microsoft’s Manhattan office, pushing teams to build, iterate, and pitch fully formed solutions to a panel of Microsoft judges in just a few hours. The energy was fast, collaborative, and brave—exactly the environment that makes Code4Hope tick.

Throughout the day we watched teams move from whiteboards to working demos, share laptops across tables, and jot last-minute edits before race-walking into the pitch room. The judges asked hard questions—how would you scale, who is your user, why now?—and every team matched the intensity with thoughtful answers rooted in real impact.

A highlight for our team was interviewing Rashmi Gupta, a Microsoft Principal Program Manager whose work straddles data, AI, and inclusive innovation. Her story is global: she grew up in Singapore, launched her career in Australia, and now builds products from New York. Rashmi spoke candidly about being a woman in STEM, the mentors who opened doors, and how navigating multiple cultures sharpened her leadership instincts. Her advice to our students was clear—bring every part of your lived experience to the table, because the problems worth solving demand that range.

Before judging kicked off, Code4Hope took the stage for a quick send-off. We reminded the room that shipping a pitch is less about perfect slides and more about conviction—what problem are you obsessed with, why does it matter today, and how will you keep momentum after the weekend? Seeing heads nod and hands fly up for final questions was the best kind of adrenaline rush.

We also delivered our entrepreneurship workshop, the same framework we debuted at C4H ‘25, updated for a New York audience. Students, judges, and volunteers leaned in as we walked through the post-hackathon roadmap: validating your first customers, defining the one metric that truly matters, and building a feedback loop that keeps you honest. Teams left with worksheets full of hypotheses to test on Monday, and a few even booked follow-up office hours on the spot.

Divergent Teams 2025 reminded us why we do this work—unlocking students who are ready to build, and surrounding them with role models who have already blazed the trail. We’re heading into the next sprint energized, grateful for Microsoft’s partnership, and ready to keep the momentum rolling.
